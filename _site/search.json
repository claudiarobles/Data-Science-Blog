    "text": "Hello!\nI am Claudia Robles, a senior at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign majoring in Information Sciences.\nSome of my hobies:\n\nI enjoy crocheting a lot! I started a two years before the pandemic in 2019. During the pandemic, I became more interested in it and started creating different items, such as key chains and hats.\nI also enjoy playing some instruments! Since 4th grade, I’ve played the violin. Because of my initial interest with that instrument, I decided to learn others. I’ve tried the cello, piano, and guitar!\nWhile I enjoy creating music, I also enjoy listening to music! Some of my favorite genres are classical music, pop, rap, and rnb.\n\nInterests:\n\nCurrently, I am very interested in video games. Over the summer, I celebrated my 21st birthday and decided to get a game console! I’ve wanted one since it came out a few years ago, but I was just recently able to purchase it. I know spend time playing Spider-Man, Call of Duty, Sack-boy, and more!\n\nAchievements:\n\nDuring my sophomore year in high school, I was able to audition and get a spot in my city’s youth symphony orchestra! I played both 1st and 2nd violin sections.\nWhen it was time to attend high school, I was given the opportunity to apply for different academies. We had one for STEM, Languages, Honors and Gifted, and Music! I applied for the Music Academy and Languages Academy. I was able to get into both and in the end, I chose the languages academy to become trilingual!\n\nFun fact:\n\nMy favorite number is 7!\n\n\n3+4\n\n[1] 7"
