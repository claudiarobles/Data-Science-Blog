As a current student at Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I like to know which as the best and easiest classes to take (I also like to take hard ones of course, I love science and math). I was inspired to look at a data set that was created by a UIUC professor: Professor Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider.

He has his own personal github:

[wadefagen (Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider) (github.com)](https://github.com/wadefagen)

Where he has all the data sets he has created. He generated a data set that combines all information in regards to classes, gpa, and professors on campus.

Beginning of analysis:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
gpa <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wadefagen/datasets/master/gpa/uiuc-gpa-dataset.csv")
```

```{r}
skim(gpa)
```

I loaded in the data set and see some information that I find interesting. The first two things I noticed are Subject and the number of students that got each letter grade.

Top 10 Classes with Highest "A" Grades

```{r}
top_10 <- head(gpa[order(gpa$A, decreasing = TRUE), ], 10)
print(top_10)
```

I decided to analyze the top 10 classes first, choosing to look at specifically the A column. It looks like a lot of CS (Computer Science) classes are in the top 10! I also see some ECON courses. This is very interesting to see! As we know a lot us believe CS is hard.
