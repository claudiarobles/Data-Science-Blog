Hello!

I am Claudia Robles, a senior at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign majoring in Information Sciences.

Some of my hobies:

-   I enjoy crocheting a lot! I started a two years before the pandemic in 2019. During the pandemic, I became more interested in it and started creating different items, such as key chains and hats.

-   I also enjoy playing some instruments! Since 4th grade, I've played the violin. Because of my initial interest with that instrument, I decided to learn others. I've tried the cello, piano, and guitar!

-   While I enjoy creating music, I also enjoy listening to music! Some of my favorite genres are classical music, pop, rap, and rnb.

Interests:

-   Currently, I am very interested in video games. Over the summer, I celebrated my 21st birthday and decided to get a game console! I've wanted one since it came out a few years ago, but I was just recently able to purchase it. I know spend time playing Spider-Man, Call of Duty, Sack-boy, and more!

Achievements:

-   During my sophomore year in high school, I was able to audition and get a spot in my city's youth symphony orchestra! I played both 1st and 2nd violin sections.

-   When it was time to attend high school, I was given the opportunity to apply for different academies. We had one for STEM, Languages, Honors and Gifted, and Music! I applied for the Music Academy and Languages Academy. I was able to get into both and in the end, I chose the languages academy to become trilingual!

Fun fact:

-   My favorite number is 7!
